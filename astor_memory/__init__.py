astor-memory: Self-owned memory system for AI agents.

3-store triplet (bus + forge + nest) with 3-tier isolation.

__version__ = "1.15.13"  # 2026-09-23 (v1.15.13: astor_capture_intent helper + hermes_adapter dead-import fix)  # 2026-09-22 (Ship v1.15.8 — RRSI pass c: edit-budget alias + roadmap spec. NEW CLI flag `am decay-sweep run --max-sweep-size N` is an alias for `--limit N`, named to match the RRSI paper's "edit budget per round" concept. Same SQL, same audit, same behavior; just the paper's vocabulary. Also: NEW docs/rrsi-roadmap.md — full spec of which of the 7 RRSI constraints are shipped (a=leakage audit, b=noise floor, c=edit budget alias) vs deferred (2=ledger rationale, 3=stagnation, 6=cost rule, 7=pruning). Deferred constraints need paired eval+token tracking or operator-side tooling not yet built; ship decision documented per R12481 (wait for post-ship data before claiming transfer) + R11887 (n<20 statistically unreliable). 468 tests pass. Verified: --max-sweep-size 5 caps eligible to 5 (legacy full sweep returns 310 at max_imp=1.0 max_access=5).)

  # 2026-09-18 (Ship v1.14.73 — Memory Decay policy + WeChat article-driven improvements). NEW CLI: `am decay-sweep run --tier public|source|private|repo [--user-id] [--max-importance 0.5] [--idle-days 30] [--low-access-count 0] [--limit 500] [--execute] [--reason <str>]` + `am decay-sweep stats ...` — auto soft-tombstone facts by importance+access_count criteria. Default dry-run reports only; pass --execute to actually tombstone + write audit log entry (actor='cli:decay-sweep', action='decay_sweep'). Reversible via restore. Inspired by WeChat article "Alan 的记录与分享 - Agent Memory Lifecycle" (mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ntcO59mPowrpiaLNGGd67Q): identifies "哪些信息应该被遗忘" as a separate lifecycle stage requiring automated policy + audit trail. Criteria design choice: dropped `last_confirmed_at` from the SQL because it gets reset on every read (fact 12055), making it useless as an idle proxy. Replaced with `access_count <= N` which actually tracks "nobody cares about this fact anymore". Also fixed 2 pre-existing CLI bootstrap bugs: registered-but-undefined `cmd_peer_allow_search`, `cmd_peer_search`, `cmd_peer_unallow_search` (added v1.14.73 stub returning `[WARN] not yet implemented` + exit 1 to unblock module import + decay-sweep ship verification).
    # 2026-09-16 (v1.14.40) Recent Capture panel: dashboard `/v1/dashboard` now exposes `recent_capture` grouped by 3 axes (kind / tier / platform) plus an 'all' flatten view. Frontend tab-toggle UI (By Kind / By Tier / By Platform / All). Each bucket capped at 10 rows. Discord/Telegram/WeChat/Cron/Manual/Other routing via `origin_session_id` prefix.

# astor_bus() / astor_forge() / astor_nest() are the unified public API entry points.
