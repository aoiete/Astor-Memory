astor-memory: Self-owned memory system for AI agents.

__version__ = "1.15.5"  # 2026-09-22 (Ship v1.15.5 — README polish + recall-auto smoke gate. README + README.zh-CN.md: 3 new CLI subsections — Recall zones (table for failure / success / lesson / all-zones / none with default success), Decay sweep (--since-canonical-id + astor_decay_event_trigger.py companion), Optional jev relevance rerank (--jev-relevance flag clearly labeled opt-in: requires D:\AI\scripts\admin\jev\, typesafe-sdk, TYPESAFE_API_KEY, and jev server — installs of astor-memory without the jev shim see no behavior change). zh-CN CLI table gained 4 rows for the new flags. NEW scripts/smoke_recall_auto.sh — 5-second liveness gate for `am recall-auto` subcommand (compile + argparse help + top-level subcommand listing). Verified: smoke_rc=0 for both recall-zone and recall-auto, py_compile OK, 0 PII. No DB migration, no public API change.)

  # 2026-09-18 (Ship v1.14.73 — Memory Decay policy + WeChat article-driven improvements). NEW CLI: `am decay-sweep run --tier public|source|private|repo [--user-id] [--max-importance 0.5] [--idle-days 30] [--low-access-count 0] [--limit 500] [--execute] [--reason <str>]` + `am decay-sweep stats ...` — auto soft-tombstone facts by importance+access_count criteria. Default dry-run reports only; pass --execute to actually tombstone + write audit log entry (actor='cli:decay-sweep', action='decay_sweep'). Reversible via restore. Inspired by WeChat article "Alan 的记录与分享 - Agent Memory Lifecycle" (mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ntcO59mPowrpiaLNGGd67Q): identifies "哪些信息应该被遗忘" as a separate lifecycle stage requiring automated policy + audit trail. Criteria design choice: dropped `last_confirmed_at` from the SQL because it gets reset on every read (fact 12055), making it useless as an idle proxy. Replaced with `access_count <= N` which actually tracks "nobody cares about this fact anymore". Also fixed 2 pre-existing CLI bootstrap bugs: registered-but-undefined `cmd_peer_allow_search`, `cmd_peer_search`, `cmd_peer_unallow_search` (added v1.14.73 stub returning `[WARN] not yet implemented` + exit 1 to unblock module import + decay-sweep ship verification).
    # 2026-09-16 (v1.14.40) Recent Capture panel: dashboard `/v1/dashboard` now exposes `recent_capture` grouped by 3 axes (kind / tier / platform) plus an 'all' flatten view. Frontend tab-toggle UI (By Kind / By Tier / By Platform / All). Each bucket capped at 10 rows. Discord/Telegram/WeChat/Cron/Manual/Other routing via `origin_session_id` prefix.

# astor_bus() / astor_forge() / astor_nest() are the unified public API entry points.
